To run the server, run a node server with the javascript file server.js. Then to
create a show, log in to the staff home page at /staff_home_page. This page
includes links to pages for creating a show, editing a show, and downloading 
attendee lists. You can only edit a show before the reserve period goes live. 

Staff Pages
===========

* /staff_home_page - A landing page for all staff functions

* /new_show - Used for creating a new show. We have provided a small example 
csv file, which can be used to test. 

* /edit_show - Edits the most recently created show. Cannot be accessed if this 
show has already entered the reserve period.

* /csv_page - Can be used to download csv file of attendees.

User Pages
